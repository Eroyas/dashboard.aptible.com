  The Endpoint Platform is the underlying AWS resource
  Aptible uses to expose your Endpoint.
  <br><br>
  ALB Endpoints provide better guarantees that your App will
  remain available if something goes wrong with a deployment,
  whereas ELB Endpoints can occasionally cause downtime.
  <br><br>
  ALBs are the default for new Endpoints. You can upgrade an
  Endpoint from ELB to ALB without downtime."}}
