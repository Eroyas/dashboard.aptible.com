  The Endpoint Platform is the underlying AWS resource Aptible uses to expose
  your Endpoint.
  <br><br>
  ALB Endpoints provide better guarantees that your App will remain available
  if something goes wrong with a deployment, whereas ELB Endpoints can
  occasionally cause downtime.
  <br><br>
  Except on Aptible legacy infrastructure where they are not available, ALBs
  are the default for new Endpoints, and you can upgrade an Endpoint from ELB
  to ALB without downtime."}}
